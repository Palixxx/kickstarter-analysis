## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose is to use historical data to visualize the relationship between outcomes and launch month of the amount of money pledged to theater campaigns. Further, estimate the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled plays based on the funding goal amount.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date & Outcomes Based on Goals
- My analysis is based on organizing data with the use of pivot tables and functions that allowed me to put the data in a clear context of visualization to understand the inputs that I am looking for.  

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
    1. Between April to July are months with the highest successful launch with a peak in May. Also, there is a success rate of 2:1 to over launch failed.
    2. There is a downtrend to be considered from the peak of May to December with a drop of 54%. Further, in December there is almost the same rate of successful to failed launch.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
I can conclude that 50% of outcomes based on successful goals are under $4,999 amount of money. Also, it registers a successful rate over failed 2:1 under this category. But as much as the goals of money increase the success rate over failure decrease. 

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
We don't have information about other years or others factors that have had an impact on the outcomes, which would be useful to see if we see the same patterns. This is a limitation that would affect our analysis and decisions.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
I would like to add some indicators as standard deviation, mean, median, mode, top successful months, histogram distribution, and others to see what conclusions we can get.
